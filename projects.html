            <h2>Swift Swift Trivia App</h2>
            <h3>Summary:</h3>
            <p>This is the first app I created using Swift and Xcode. 
                For this project, I decided to make a trivia app with 
                questions based on Taylor Swift. As of now, there's 10
                questions total, but more questions can be added. There
                is a welcome screen, n question pages (n being
                number of questions), and a score screen. The user has
                the option to retake the quiz too.</p>

            <h2>Door Hinge Calculator</h2>
            <h3>Summary:</h3>
            <p>I created a primarily JavaScript application while also 
                using HTML and CSS for a company's website. The purpose 
                of this application is to allow a user to input door 
                dimensions and give back possible hinge solutions given 
                the dimensions. In this case, the door hinge models 
                correspond to a specific company's door hinge models.
                This calculator was created using existing nomographs and
                converted into an application.</p>
